This is the code for the Any Orange website!
Here you can select and buy any and as many different oranges as you like.

# Why it was created
Any orange was created for Task 18 of my software development skills bootcamp where we were expected to combine Python code, HTML text and CSS styling guidelines.

# Enjoy looking around!
